## NetworkConfig.transportTimeoutS property

The network timeout for transport operations.

This controls how long Holochain will spend waiting for connections to be established and other low-level network operations.

If you are writing tests that start and stop conductors, you may want to set this to a lower value to avoid waiting for connections to conductors that are no longer running.

Default: 15

**Signature:**

```typescript
transportTimeoutS?: number;
```
