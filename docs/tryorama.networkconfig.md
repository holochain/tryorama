_(Optional)_ The interval in seconds between initiating gossip rounds.

This controls how often gossip will attempt to find a peer to gossip with. This can be set as low as you'd like, but you will still be limited by minInitiateIntervalMs. So a low value for this will result in gossip doing its initiation in a burst. Then, when it has run out of peers, it will idle for a while.

Default: 100

_(Optional)_ The minimum amount of time that must be allowed to pass before a gossip round can be initiated by a given peer.

This is a rate-limiting mechanism to be enforced against incoming gossip and therefore must be respected when initiating too.
